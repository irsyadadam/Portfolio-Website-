TODO: SEE WHAT PACKAGES ARE INSTALLED EXACTLY
Run commands to install Chakra UI, Framer Motion, etc... 
    - npm init -y
    - npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion next react react-dom
    - npm i -D eslint eslint-config-next prettier

Edit package.json to make sure that the project knows which packages to use.

Create .eslintrc.json,  prettier.config.json, .prettierignore to tell pakages which configs to use.
